## Practicing Redux and webpack

Started date: 28.11.2020

To create a main.js bundle run npx webpack,\
which will take our script at src/index.js as the entry point,\
and will generate dist/main.js as the output. The npx command,\
which ships with Node 8.2/npm 5.2.0 or higher,\
runs the webpack binary (./node_modules/.bin/webpack)
