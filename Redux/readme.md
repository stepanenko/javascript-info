## Practicing Redux and webpack

Started date: 28.11.2020
Finished on: https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/

To build run `npm run build`. This will generate `dist` folder with `index.html`, `bundle.js`, etc.

To build with `npx` run `npx webpack`.\
The `npx` command (from Node 8.2+), runs the webpack binary from `./node_modules/.bin/webpack`
