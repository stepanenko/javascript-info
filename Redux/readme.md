## Practicing Redux and webpack

Started date: 28.11.2020

Finished on: https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/

To Do:
- cases from Eve Porcello course: "Learning webpack 4"
- create a Docker container
- deploy to AWS

\
To build run `npm run build`. This will generate `dist` folder with `index.html`, `bundle.js`, etc.
> With this npm script, webpack will be run from our local `node_modules` by default

\
To build with `npx` run `npx webpack`.
> The `npx` command (from Node 8.2+), runs the webpack binary from `./node_modules/.bin/webpack`
