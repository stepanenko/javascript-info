## Practicing Redux and webpack

Started date: 28.11.2020
Finished on: https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/

To build run `npm run build`

To create a bundle run `npx webpack`, it takes our script at `src/index.js`,\
and generates `dist/bundle.js` as the output. The `npx` command (from Node 8.2+),\
runs the webpack binary (`./node_modules/.bin/webpack`)
