### JS Notes:
- An asynchronous function is a function which operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit Promise to return its result.
- In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time (every time you create a function, you are taking a picture of it)
- Every time a function is created, we throw away the old picture and take a new one.
