### Books:
- [Books](https://github.com/stepanenko/javascript-info/blob/master/BOOKS.md)

### JS Notes:
- In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time (every time you are create a function, you are taking a picture of it)
- Every time the function is created, we throw away the old picture and take a new one.
- When React re-renders a component tree, it just re-runs everything top down.
