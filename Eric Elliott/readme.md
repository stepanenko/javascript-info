There are three different kinds of prototypal OO:
- Concatenative inheritance
- Prototype delegation
- Functional inheritance

In JavaScript, any function can return a new object. When it’s not a constructor function or class, it’s called a factory function.

ES6 classes desugar to constructor functions, so everything that follows about constructor functions also applies to ES6 classes.

What’s the Difference Between a Factory and a Constructor?  
Constructors force callers to use the new keyword. Factories don’t. That’s it, but that has some relevant side-effects.
