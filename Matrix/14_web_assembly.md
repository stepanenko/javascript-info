# WebAssembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary format that allows code from languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in web browsers and other environments with near-native performance. It's compact, secure, and portable, making it ideal for high-performance applications like gaming, media processing, and scientific computing.

### Key Points

- High Performance: Near-native speeds
- Portable: Runs across platforms
- Secure: Sandboxed execution
- Compact: Smaller file sizes for faster loading

### Use Cases

- Gaming
- Media Processing
- Scientific Computing
- Machine Learning

WebAssembly enhances web capabilities by bringing native performance to web applications.
