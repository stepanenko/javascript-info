# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.  
They are commonly used for searching, validation, and string manipulation.

## Literal Characters
Match exact characters in the pattern: `hello` matches the string `"hello"`


## Metacharacters
Special characters with specific meanings:

`.` Matches any single character (except newline)  
`^` Matches the start of a string  
`$` Matches the end of a string  
`*` Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element  
`+` Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element  
`?` Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element
