# Scope and Closure

**Scope** defines where variables and functions are accessible in your code.  
JavaScript has **global**, **function**, and **block scope** (introduced with `let` and `const`).  

Definition 1:  
**Closure** is a feature where an inner function remembers the variables in its outer functionâ€™s scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. When a function is returned or passed around, it retains access to the variables of the scope in which it was created.

Definition 2:  
**Closure** is a feature where a function retains access to its lexical scope (the surrounding state) even when the function is executed outside that scope. This means that the function "remembers" the environment in which it was created.
