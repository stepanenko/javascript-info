## [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns)

- Design patterns are advanced object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems.  
- Each pattern has a name and becomes part of a vocabulary when discussing complex design solutions.

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software development. They are not specific to a particular programming language or framework, but rather they are abstract concepts that can be applied in various situations.

The GoF patterns are a set of 23 design patterns that were first introduced in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides. These patterns are divided into three categories:

Creational | Structural | Behavioral
---------- | ---------- | ----------
Abstract Factory | Adapter | Chain of Resp
Builder | Bridge | Command
Factory Method | Composite | Interpreter
Prototype | Decorator | Iterator
Singleton | Facade | Mediator
 --- | Flyweight | Memento
 --- | Proxy | Observer
 --- | --- | State
 --- | --- | Strategy
 --- | --- | Template Method
 --- | --- | Visitor
