  <h1><a href="https://javascript.info/modules-intro">MODULES</a></h1>

  <p>If the same module is imported into multiple other places, its code is executed only the first time, then exports are given to all importers.</p>

  <p>So, let’s reiterate – the module is executed only once. Exports are generated, and then they are shared between importers, so if something changes the admin object, other modules will see that.</p>

  <p>The object import.meta contains the information about the current module. In the browser, it contains the url of the script, if inside HTML - current webpage url.</p>

  <p>In a module, top-level <code>this</code> is undefined.</p>

  <p>The defer attribute tells the browser that it should go on working with the page, and load the script “in background”, then run the script when it loads.</p>

  <p>In practice, defer is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important. And async is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads. And their relative execution order does not matter.</p>

  <script type="module" src="./init.js"></script>
  <script type="module">
    import { sayHi, admin } from './admin.js';
    const h2 = document.querySelector('.h2');
    h2.innerHTML = sayHi();

    let user = 'Vasya';

    console.log(admin.name);
    console.log(import.meta);
  </script>
  <script type="module">
    // console.log(user); // ReferenceError: user is not defined
  </script>
